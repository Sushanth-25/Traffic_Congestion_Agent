- This indicates system operating beyond design capacity

## 7. Recommendations for Time-Based Analysis

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Use historical data to establish baseline patterns
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Flag deviations from expected patterns
3. **Predictive Alerts**: Issue warnings before known peak periods
4. **Demand Management**: Suggest alternate travel times to users
5. **Signal Optimization**: Adjust signal timing based on time-of-day patterns
