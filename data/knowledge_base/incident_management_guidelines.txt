# Incident Management and Traffic Impact Guidelines

## 1. Types of Traffic Incidents

### 1.1 Vehicle Accidents
- **Minor**: Fender benders, no injuries, vehicles movable
  - Typical clearance time: 15-30 minutes
  - Lane blockage: Usually 1 lane
  - Congestion impact: Low to Moderate

- **Moderate**: Property damage, possible minor injuries
  - Typical clearance time: 30-60 minutes
  - Lane blockage: 1-2 lanes
  - Congestion impact: Moderate to Heavy

- **Severe**: Serious injuries, multiple vehicles, emergency response required
  - Typical clearance time: 1-3 hours
  - Lane blockage: Multiple lanes or full closure
  - Congestion impact: Severe, may affect alternate routes

### 1.2 Vehicle Breakdowns
- **Standard Breakdown**: Engine failure, flat tire
  - Clearance time: 20-45 minutes
  - Impact: Typically 1 lane, low congestion

- **Commercial Vehicle Breakdown**: Trucks, buses
  - Clearance time: 45-90 minutes
  - Impact: May block multiple lanes, moderate congestion

### 1.3 Road Construction/Maintenance
- **Scheduled Roadwork**
  - Duration: Hours to months
  - Impact: Reduced capacity, predictable patterns
  - Mitigation: Advance public notification

- **Emergency Repairs**
  - Duration: Hours to days
  - Impact: Unexpected congestion spikes
  - Mitigation: Real-time alerts, detour planning

### 1.4 Special Events
- **Planned Events**: Concerts, sports, festivals
  - Impact: Predictable surge in demand
  - Mitigation: Traffic management plans, public transport promotion

- **Unplanned Gatherings**: Protests, VIP movements
  - Impact: Unpredictable road closures
  - Mitigation: Real-time response, alternate route activation

## 2. Incident Impact Calculation

### 2.1 Capacity Reduction Formula
For each blocked lane:
- 1 lane blocked on 2-lane road: 65-75% capacity reduction
- 1 lane blocked on 3-lane road: 45-55% capacity reduction
- 1 lane blocked on 4-lane road: 30-40% capacity reduction

### 2.2 Queue Formation
Queue length grows at approximately:
- 25-35 vehicles per minute per blocked lane during peak hours
- 10-15 vehicles per minute per blocked lane during off-peak

### 2.3 Clearance Time Impact
Every 10 minutes of incident duration adds approximately:
- 3-5 minutes additional delay for upstream traffic
- 15-20% extension to overall congestion duration

## 3. Incident Severity Classification

### Level 1: Minor
- **Criteria**: No lane blockage, or shoulder only
- **Response**: Routine clearance
- **Expected Duration**: < 30 minutes
- **Congestion Impact**: Minimal

### Level 2: Moderate
- **Criteria**: 1-2 lanes blocked, no major injuries
- **Response**: Priority clearance
- **Expected Duration**: 30-60 minutes
- **Congestion Impact**: Moderate (30-50% speed reduction)

### Level 3: Major
- **Criteria**: Multiple lanes blocked, injuries, emergency response
- **Response**: Full incident management protocol
- **Expected Duration**: 1-2 hours
- **Congestion Impact**: Severe (50-70% speed reduction)

### Level 4: Critical
- **Criteria**: Full road closure, fatalities, hazmat
- **Response**: Multi-agency coordination
- **Expected Duration**: 2+ hours
- **Congestion Impact**: Maximum, spillover to alternate routes

## 4. Incident-Congestion Relationship Patterns

### 4.1 Peak Hour Incidents
Incidents during peak hours cause:
- 3-4x longer congestion duration than off-peak
- Faster queue formation
- Greater spillover to adjacent roads

### 4.2 Incident Clustering
Multiple incidents in proximity cause:
- Compounded congestion effects
- Reduced alternate route effectiveness
- Extended recovery time

### 4.3 Secondary Incidents
Congestion from primary incidents increases risk of secondary incidents by:
- 20-30% within the first hour
- Often more severe due to distracted/frustrated drivers

## 5. Recommendations for Incident-Related Congestion

1. **Quick Clearance**: Every minute of faster clearance saves 4-5 minutes of congestion
2. **Early Detection**: Use sensors/cameras to identify incidents within 2 minutes
3. **Public Communication**: Issue alerts within 5 minutes of incident confirmation
4. **Alternate Routes**: Pre-plan and activate detours for common incident locations
5. **Post-Incident Monitoring**: Continue monitoring for 30-60 minutes after clearance

## 6. Bangalore-Specific Incident Patterns

### High-Incident Locations
- Silk Board Junction
- KR Puram Bridge
- Marathahalli Bridge
- Hebbal Flyover

### Peak Incident Times
- Morning peak: 8:30 AM - 10:00 AM
- Evening peak: 5:30 PM - 8:00 PM
- Weekend evenings: Higher alcohol-related incidents
