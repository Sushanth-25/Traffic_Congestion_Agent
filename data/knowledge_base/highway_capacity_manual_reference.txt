# Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) Standards Reference

## Overview
This document provides key concepts from the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2022,
the authoritative reference for traffic capacity and level-of-service analysis.

## 1. Level of Service (LOS) Definitions

### LOS A - Free Flow
- Volume-to-Capacity Ratio: 0.00 - 0.35
- Average Speed: > 90% of free-flow speed
- Characteristics: Drivers can maintain desired speeds, no delays
- Traffic Density: ≤ 11 pc/mi/ln

### LOS B - Reasonably Free Flow
- Volume-to-Capacity Ratio: 0.35 - 0.54
- Average Speed: > 70% of free-flow speed
- Characteristics: Slight reduction in maneuverability
- Traffic Density: 11-18 pc/mi/ln

### LOS C - Stable Flow
- Volume-to-Capacity Ratio: 0.54 - 0.77
- Average Speed: > 50% of free-flow speed
- Characteristics: Noticeable restriction in maneuverability
- Traffic Density: 18-26 pc/mi/ln

### LOS D - Approaching Unstable Flow
- Volume-to-Capacity Ratio: 0.77 - 0.93
- Average Speed: 40-50% of free-flow speed
- Characteristics: Limited ability to maneuver, minor incidents cause queuing
- Traffic Density: 26-35 pc/mi/ln

### LOS E - Unstable Flow (At Capacity)
- Volume-to-Capacity Ratio: 0.93 - 1.00
- Average Speed: 25-40% of free-flow speed
- Characteristics: Operating at capacity, no gaps for maneuvers
- Traffic Density: 35-45 pc/mi/ln

### LOS F - Forced/Breakdown Flow
- Volume-to-Capacity Ratio: > 1.00
- Average Speed: < 25% of free-flow speed
- Characteristics: Stop-and-go conditions, queue formation
- Traffic Density: > 45 pc/mi/ln

## 2. Capacity Concepts

### Theoretical Capacity
Maximum number of vehicles that can pass a point in one hour under ideal conditions:
- Freeway: 2,400 pc/hr/ln (passenger cars per hour per lane)
- Multi-lane Highway: 2,200 pc/hr/ln
- Two-lane Highway: 1,700 pc/hr (both directions combined)
- Signalized Intersection: 1,800 veh/hr/ln (ideal saturation flow)

### Practical Capacity
Adjusted for:
- Heavy vehicle percentage
- Grade conditions
- Lane width
- Lateral clearance
- Driver population (commuter vs. recreational)

## 3. Delay Analysis at Signalized Intersections

### Control Delay Components
1. **Deceleration Delay**: Time lost slowing down
2. **Queue Move-up Delay**: Time in queue behind other vehicles
3. **Stopped Delay**: Time completely stopped
4. **Acceleration Delay**: Time lost speeding up

### LOS Criteria for Signalized Intersections
| LOS | Control Delay (sec/veh) |
|-----|------------------------|
| A   | ≤ 10                   |
| B   | > 10 and ≤ 20          |
| C   | > 20 and ≤ 35          |
| D   | > 35 and ≤ 55          |
| E   | > 55 and ≤ 80          |
| F   | > 80                   |

## 4. Travel Time Reliability Metrics

### Travel Time Index (TTI)
Ratio of actual travel time to free-flow travel time:
- TTI = 1.0: Free flow (no congestion)
- TTI = 1.3: 30% longer than free flow (moderate congestion)
- TTI = 1.5: 50% longer (heavy congestion)
- TTI ≥ 2.0: Double travel time (severe congestion)

### Planning Time Index (PTI)
95th percentile travel time divided by free-flow time:
- Accounts for worst-case scenarios
- Used for trip planning with high reliability needs

### Buffer Index
Extra time needed to ensure on-time arrival:
Buffer = (95th percentile time - average time) / average time

## 5. Queue Analysis

### Queue Length Estimation
For oversaturated conditions:
Q = (arrival rate - capacity) × duration

### Queue Dissipation Time
Time for queue to clear after demand drops below capacity:
T_clear = Q / (capacity - reduced demand rate)

## 6. Application to Bangalore Context

### Typical Bangalore Corridor Metrics
- Peak Hour Factor: 0.85-0.95
- Heavy Vehicle Percentage: 5-15%
- Pedestrian Interference Factor: High (reduces capacity 10-20%)
- Signal Coordination: Variable (often suboptimal)

### Bangalore-Specific Adjustments
1. Two-wheeler dominance: Increases PCU capacity
2. Mixed traffic: Reduces overall efficiency
3. Encroachments: Reduces effective lane width
4. Bus stops without bays: Creates bottlenecks

## 7. Congestion Metrics Summary

| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| V/C Ratio | Volume ÷ Capacity | > 1.0 indicates oversaturation |
| TTI | Actual Time ÷ Free Flow Time | Higher = more congestion |
| Delay | Actual - Expected Time | Seconds of excess travel |
| Queue | Vehicles waiting | Higher = more severe |
| Speed | Distance ÷ Time | Lower = more congestion |
