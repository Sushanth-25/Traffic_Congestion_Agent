# Traffic Congestion Classification and Analysis Guidelines

## 1. Definition of Traffic Congestion

Traffic congestion occurs when travel demand approaches or exceeds the available capacity of a road network. It is characterized by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queueing.

## 2. Congestion Level Classification

### 2.1 Light Congestion (0-30% capacity utilization)
- **Characteristics**: Free-flowing traffic, minimal delays
- **Average Speed**: Near posted speed limits
- **Travel Time Index**: 1.0 - 1.1
- **Operator Action**: No intervention required

### 2.2 Moderate Congestion (30-60% capacity utilization)
- **Characteristics**: Stable flow with some restrictions
- **Average Speed**: 70-85% of free-flow speed
- **Travel Time Index**: 1.1 - 1.3
- **Operator Action**: Monitor for escalation

### 2.3 Heavy Congestion (60-85% capacity utilization)
- **Characteristics**: Unstable flow, frequent slowdowns
- **Average Speed**: 50-70% of free-flow speed
- **Travel Time Index**: 1.3 - 1.5
- **Operator Action**: Consider signal timing adjustments, issue alerts

### 2.4 Severe Congestion (85-100% capacity utilization)
- **Characteristics**: Breakdown conditions, stop-and-go traffic
- **Average Speed**: Below 50% of free-flow speed
- **Travel Time Index**: Above 1.5
- **Operator Action**: Immediate intervention, alternate route advisories

## 3. Travel Time Index (TTI)

The Travel Time Index represents how much longer a trip takes during congestion compared to free-flow conditions:

- TTI = 1.0: No congestion (free flow)
- TTI = 1.2: 20% longer travel time
- TTI = 1.5: 50% longer travel time
- TTI = 2.0: Double the normal travel time

## 4. Road Capacity Utilization

Road capacity utilization indicates what percentage of maximum throughput is currently being used:

- Below 70%: Road operating efficiently
- 70-85%: Approaching capacity, sensitive to disruptions
- 85-95%: Over-saturated, high probability of breakdown
- Above 95%: Severe congestion, flow breakdown likely

## 5. Congestion Duration Patterns

### 5.1 Short-term Congestion (< 30 minutes)
Usually caused by temporary disruptions like traffic signals or minor incidents.

### 5.2 Medium-term Congestion (30 minutes - 2 hours)
Often associated with peak hour patterns or moderate incidents.

### 5.3 Long-term Congestion (> 2 hours)
Typically caused by major incidents, road closures, or special events.

## 6. Key Performance Indicators for Traffic Operators

1. **Average Speed**: Direct measure of traffic flow quality
2. **Volume-to-Capacity Ratio**: Indicates stress on road infrastructure
3. **Queue Length**: Visual indicator of congestion severity
4. **Incident Clearance Time**: Affects congestion duration
5. **Travel Time Reliability**: Consistency of journey times
